# QuickPub v0.1.0-alpha

## Notes

File uploading and probably lots of other things do not work in this version

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get this version of QuickPub working you will need a web server with php 5 or up. For simplicity I'm going to assume that anyone who is using QuickPub at this point knows what they're doing, and has a web server already installed.

### Installing

Clone the repository with git and change to the 'v0.1.0-alpha' branch:
```
git clone https://github.com/hazzdood/QuickPub.git
git checkout v0.1.0-alpha
```

Or download though your browser:
`https://github.com/hazzdood/QuickPub/archive/v0.1.0-alpha.zip`

Copy the contents of the `QuickPub` directory to your web server. In a production environment only the www directory should be accessible from the web.

### Troubleshooting

I really don't know, google it?
